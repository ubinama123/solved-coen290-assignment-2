This assignment, you are given two data files. The data files are a representation of a faceobject.The two files are:face-vertices.data:every line of this file is (x, y, z) coordinates of a 3D pointsface-index.txt:every line of this file are 3 indices.each index is an entry in face-vertices.data file referring to one vertex coordinateso the 3 indices indicate 3 vertices of a triangle.Write a program (python or any other program you prefer), to read this file and display theobject in two mode:

– points: display all coordinates– wireframe: display all triangles

do not use 3D library, instead, project the 3D coordinates to 2D screen yourself, usingthe perspective projection equations we talked about in class.extra credit: interactive rotation and zoom in and zoom out.
